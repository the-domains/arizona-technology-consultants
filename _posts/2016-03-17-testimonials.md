## James and his team made a great website for our company. James was an expert and was our main point of contact. He is a great listener, and as a result of those listening skills, was able to implement the vision we had for our site to the tee. I recommend working with him to anyone!

Our company needed some assistance moving our website and web mail on very short notice. James provided excellent and professional service, and was able to quickly come up with a plan of action and walk us through the process so we were ready for the switch. I would definitely contact him if we needed any additional work, and I highly recommend him to anyone else looking to use his services. Personable, professional and solid service. What more could you ask for?

In 2008 Clean Metal Industries was just getting started, and in order to operate a business in the 21st century, we needed reliable IT service and internet exposure. We signed up with James soon after opening the doors and in addition to providing "grade A" care he worked within our budget. He is still our data expert today and we have entrusted many others to his professional opinion.

James has always been consistent and reliable. Anytime our system went down he was there to correct the problem. Would highly recommend James.
